## API Endpoints

The backend provides several API endpoints:

### Token Analysis
- `POST /api/analyze-token` - Analyze token trades and assign numbers to buyers
  - Body: `{ tokenAddress, startDate, endDate, minPrice, timezone }`
  - Returns: Numbered list of buy trades (1-69)

### Wallet & Transaction Data
- `GET /api/transactions/:address` - Get all transactions for a wallet
- `GET /api/token-transfers/:address` - Get token transfers
- `GET /api/sol-transfers/:address` - Get SOL transfers
- `GET /api/transaction/:signature` - Get specific transaction details

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (Vanilla)
- **APIs**: 
  - Helius RPC (Enhanced transaction data & DEX parsing)
  - Solscan Public API (Transaction history)
  - CoinGecko API (Historical SOL/USD pricing)
- **Dependencies**: 
  - axios (HTTP client)
  - cors (Cross-origin resource sharing)
  - dotenv (Environment variables)

## üöÄ Deployment to Railway

### Step 1: Push to GitHub
```bash
# The repository is already initialized with all files committed

# Add your GitHub repository (replace with your actual repo URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/universal-lottery-drawing.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin master
```

### Step 2: Deploy to Railway
1. Go to [Railway.app](https://railway.app) and sign up/login with GitHub
2. Click **"New Project"** ‚Üí **"Deploy from GitHub repo"**
3. Select your `universal-lottery-drawing` repository
4. Railway will auto-detect your Node.js app and install dependencies
5. Add environment variables in Railway dashboard:
   - `HELIUS_API_KEY` = `your-helius-api-key-here`
   - Railway auto-sets `PORT`, but you can set it to `3000` if needed
6. Click **"Deploy"**
7. Wait for deployment to complete (~2-3 minutes)
8. Railway will give you a public URL like `https://universal-lottery-drawing.up.railway.app`

### Step 3: Optional - Add Custom Domain
1. In Railway dashboard, go to your project Settings
2. Under **"Domains"**, click "Generate Domain" for a Railway subdomain
3. Or add your own custom domain and update DNS records

### Environment Variables for Railway:
```bash
HELIUS_API_KEY=your-helius-api-key-here
PORT=3000
NODE_ENV=production
DATABASE_URL=your-postgres-url (optional, for persistent storage)
```

### Railway Features:

### After Deployment:
Your drawing system will be live at your Railway URL! Users can:

- Check if they're in the first 69 buyers
- View and save drawing results
- Access the admin panel to manage blocklist
- Use the diagnostic scan page for troubleshooting

## How It Works

**Blockchain:** Solana  
**Supported Tokens:** ANY Solana SPL token  

The drawing system automatically tracks all buys of your specified token and assigns numbers 1-69 to the first buyers within your selected time range. The system is completely universal and works with any Solana token address.

## Notes

- **Helius API Key Required**: Already configured! The key is set in the server.
- **Rate Limits**: The app includes built-in delays to prevent hitting API rate limits.
- **Drawing Time**: Drawing lottery balls can take a few minutes depending on the number of transactions. Be patient!
- **Supported DEXes**: Tracks token buys from Raydium, Jupiter, Pump.fun, and other major Solana DEXes.
- **Drawing Numbers**: Numbers 1-69 are assigned chronologically to the first 69 buyers in your time range.
- **Verification**: All results are verifiable on-chain. Click "View" to see any transaction on Solscan.
- **Universal Support**: Works with ANY Solana token - just paste the contract address!
- All times support multiple timezones for global accessibility

## Troubleshooting

### Drawing Issues
- **"Failed to analyze token"**: Check that the token address is valid and exists on Solana
- **"Please enter a valid Solana address"**: Make sure the token address is a valid base58 Solana address (32-44 characters)
- **No drawing winners found**: Try expanding the date range to include more trading activity
- **Slow drawing process**: This is normal if there are many transactions. The system checks each one for buys.
- **Can't find my wallet**: Make sure you bought during the selected time range and your transaction went through

### General Issues
- Make sure the server is running on port 3000
- Check that you have a stable internet connection
- Check the browser console and server logs for detailed error messages
- If Helius rate limits are hit, wait a few minutes and try again
- All drawing results are verifiable on-chain via Solscan links

## Future Enhancements

- Token transfer tracking
- Export to CSV functionality
- Advanced analytics and charts
- Multiple wallet comparison
- Real-time transaction monitoring
- Notification alerts
