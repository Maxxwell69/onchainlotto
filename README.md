## LOTTA AF Token Information

**Token Name:** Lotta AF  
**Contract Address:** `FvNcnFnWtschwYRNP758bg5yqmXBUKdDDcUcbrVvKLHv`  
**Blockchain:** Solana  

The drawing system automatically tracks all buys of $LOTTA AF and assigns numbers 1-69 to the first buyers within your selected time range.

## Notes

- **Helius API Key Required**: Already configured! The key is set in the server.
- **Rate Limits**: The app includes built-in delays to prevent hitting API rate limits.
- **Drawing Time**: Drawing drawing numbers can take a few minutes depending on the number of transactions. Be patient!
- **Supported DEXes**: Tracks $LOTTA AF buys from Raydium, Jupiter, Pump.fun, and other major DEXes.
- **Drawing Numbers**: Numbers 1-69 are assigned chronologically to the first 69 buyers in your time range.
- **Verification**: All results are verifiable on-chain. Click "View" to see any transaction on Solscan.
- All times support multiple timezones for global accessibility

## Troubleshooting

### Drawing Draw Issues
- **"Failed to analyze token"**: The Helius API key is already configured in the server
- **No drawing winners found**: Try expanding the date range to include more trading activity
- **Slow drawing draw**: This is normal if there are many $LOTTA AF transactions. The system checks each one.
- **Can't find my wallet**: Make sure you bought during the selected time range and your transaction went through

### General Issues
- Make sure the server is running on port 3000
- Check that you have a stable internet connection
- Check the browser console and server logs for detailed error messages
- If Helius rate limits are hit, wait a few minutes and try again
- All drawing results are verifiable on-chain via Solscan links

## Future Enhancements

- Token transfer tracking
- Export to CSV functionality
- Advanced analytics and charts
- Multiple wallet comparison
- Real-time transaction monitoring
- Notification alerts
